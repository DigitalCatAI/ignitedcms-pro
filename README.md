### Folder Structure
At first glance the sheer number of files and folder can seem daunting, but don't worry, there are only two real places you will be spending most of your time inside. The template directory which is under: 
```
application > views > custom
```
and possibly the custom controller directory which is under: 
```
application > controllers > custom
```
This is where you might write your own custom controllers to communicate with a new table in the database. 

The place where all your uploads are stored is contained within the folder: 
```
assets > uploads
```
You shouln't need to touch any other files, as the ignitedCMS engine does everything else
